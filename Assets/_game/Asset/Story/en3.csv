0,mc,(Username),Good morning George. You've worked hard.
1,mc,(Username),I brought little Emily here. I wonder how our patient is doing now?
2,George,George Ruggs,Hey good morning my dear and lovely Emily.
3,Emily,Emily,(beep) (happy expression)
4,George,George Ruggs,I've been observing Andrew's condition and there have been some changes recently.
5,mc,(Username),Good job George.
6,mc,(Username),Can you tell me some details?
7,George,George Ruggs,Ah you know his condition has always been quite uncertain.
8,George,George Ruggs,Sometimes it's good sometimes it's not so good. Just like getting up every morning you're always unsure what kind of day it will be.
9,Emily,Emily,Emily suspects you're alluding to your own condition.
10,George,George Ruggs,(Pause) Ehe.
11,Emily,Emily,...
12,George,George Ruggs,But to be honest Andrew's condition is indeed worrying.
13,George,George Ruggs,I'll do my best to observe.
14,mc,(Username),Haha otherwise you should work harder so we don't have to worry.
15,mc,(Username),Anyway we have to go see him as soon as possible and find out the details.
16,Emily,Emily,Emily agree.
17,Emily,Emily,You two can evaluate Mr. Andrew's condition by talking to him and running some tests.
18,Emily,Emily,At the same time Emily can analyze the monitoring data to see if there are any unusual patterns or trends.
19,mc,(Username),Ok maybe we can find some solutions based on the conversation.
20,George,George Ruggs,It sounds like a perfect solution.
21,George,George Ruggs,But I must remind you that Andrew's situation may not be as optimistic as you two think.
22,George,George Ruggs,"Like I said it's very uncertain, sometimes good and sometimes bad."
23,George,George Ruggs,Maybe we were chatting well in the last second and we have to introduce ourselves again in the next second.
24,mc,(Username),...
25,Emily,Emily,Based on what you said before even in a joking tone it's not such a serious situation.
26,George,George Ruggs,My bad Emily.
27,mc,(Username),Okay you two stop making trouble.
28,mc,(Username),We should go to Andrew's ward.
29,George,George Ruggs,Yes dear. Let's go to the front desk to get the medical records and room keys.
30,George,George Ruggs,In order to prevent Andrew from disappearing suddenly we decided to lock the door and windows of the ward.
31,Emily,Emily,Correction: Humans cannot disappear out of thin air adn it is recommended to change to missing.
32,George,George Ruggs,... Emily you are getting less and less cute.
33,George,George Ruggs,Anyway let's go to the front desk to get the medical records and room keys.
